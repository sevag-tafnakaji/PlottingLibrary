# PlottingLibrary
Using OpenGL and C++ to make a plotting library similar to matplotlib in Python. The instructions here are mainly for Ubuntu 24.04, as that is the OS that I developed on.

# Dependencies

The project depends on OpenGL. In order to make use of it, I am using GLFW and glad to manage the windows and drawing and such.


Follow installation steps for GLFW and GLAD [here](https://medium.com/geekculture/a-beginners-guide-to-setup-opengl-in-linux-debian-2bfe02ccd1e). Note that while they suggest OpenGL 3.3 in the guide, you can install the latest version that your GPU can handle.
